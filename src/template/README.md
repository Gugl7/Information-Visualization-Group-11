# Dashboard visualization

To start the visualization, just type into the console `python -m http.server`.
Then just navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/` and go to `src/template/template.html` and open it.
There you can see the visualization and interact with it.
Alternatively, you can just navigate to `https://gugl7.github.io/Information-Visualization-Group-11/src/template/template.html` to see the dashboard available online.
